# Architecture

This file can be used to detail:

* in terms of accessibility i used the package downshift, 'Primitive to build simple, flexible, WAI-ARIA compliant enhanced input React components'.
* each component has all the associated ARIA compliant props
* downshift allows you to use your arrow keys to navigate the search results aswell
* i wish i managed to only show results which began with the term 'sydney', i had an idea to use indexOf to compare the inputValue to the results names.
* i really wanted to implement a few testing features like jest snapshots and enzyme, but the configuration takes a lot of time and i wanted to focus on the code.
* i wish i had more time to make it aesthetic but it does the required purpose right now so i'm happy.
* linter would be amazing too
